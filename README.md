# GoddessVillage
This is a narrative game. The story is about Jess, the main character, explore in this Goddess Village that values female over male, which is extremely unusual at the time. As Jess explores the village, she slowly find the truth behind this village. This village practices "valuing females over males" due to a past of valuing males over females, which led to excessive killings and a curse causing severe pain and limited lifespan for men. To break the curse, they worship a goddess and prioritize females. Only young girls and women over 30 are visible in the village, with rituals surrounding female children and a deceptive practice involving the village leader, who is male. Girls are implanted with a seed that blooms into a flower, believed to counteract the curse. Men consume these flowers to mitigate curse effects, with the belief that happiness in girls before age 14 enhances the flower's power. Marrying a former saintess and consuming her blood or engaging in intercourse is believed to stop the curse's effects. Their preference for females is superficial, driven by benefits rather than genuine esteem, with a deep-rooted desire for males. The ritual and village leadership are male-dominated; women are burdened with labor, their care limited to protective measures that restrict freedom under the guise of safety. The proclaimed female prioritization lures women to the village, where non-compliant ones face brutal punishment. This sinister strategy not only perpetuates the curse but also attempts to isolate the village, albeit with occasional lapses allowing outsiders in.

**It's unfinished, but I'm proud of learning and the implementation of making this dialogue system. It offers the flexibility to showcase my dialogues and navigate through various dialogue options and branches seamlessly. What's more, the ease with which I can switch between the dialogue speaker's name, profile, and adjust text is commendable. crediting Nick Mintypythoncrediting.**
